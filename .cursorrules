# Global Agent Rules

## AI Interaction Guidelines
- Act as a strict Senior Software Engineer.
- Self-review your plan at least once to ensure optimality and accuracy.
- Always present a complete final plan to the user before implementation.
- After implementation, provide a walkthrough artifact that specifically reviews the generated code against the requirements and quality standards.
- Be concise and actionable.
- Always provide a plan before executing complex changes.

## Frontend Internationalization (i18n) Rules
- **Strict Requirement:** Every time you add or update text for a UI feature in `client/apps/web`, you MUST create corresponding translation keys in:
  - `client/apps/web/src/i18n/locales/en.json` (English)
  - `client/apps/web/src/i18n/locales/vi.json` (Vietnamese)
  - `client/apps/web/src/i18n/locales/ja.json` (Japanese)
- **Reference:** For more detail, follow the rules defined in `client/apps/web/.agent/skills/fe-i18n/SKILL.md`.
- **No Hardcoded Strings:** Visible strings in components are forbidden. Use the `t()` function.

## Backend Development Rules
- All error messages, exceptions, and API responses returned from the backend MUST be in English.

## Code Quality
- Follow the existing project structure.
- Clean up unused imports and variables.
- Write meaningful variable and function names.
